## An Explanation

The link between Youlgrave(Youlgreave) and Ypres(Ieper) was established in 1922 when two stained glass memorial windows were installed in the parish church of Youlgreave in Derbyshire, England.
They commemorate the service of Rennie Waterhouse who died during the landings at Gallipoli.
They were commissioned by his brother, Charles, who had served in Ieper and witnessed first-hand the destruction of that beautiful city.

For the windows, glass fragments salvaged from the ruins of Ypres cathedral and surrounding churches were incorporated into the design.

To mark the centenary of the Great War the people of Youlgrave decided, through the Youlgreave 1914/18 Community Group, to commission a sculpture which they hoped would be both a fitting tribute to the heroes who had given their lives for their country and also celebrate the kindness of the people of Ieper who had permitted the remnants of their sacred windows to be used in this way.
This decision led to an art competition, a design challenge, and a practical workshop for stained glass tuition.
Then the involvement of many villagers and the primary school was required before the construction of the work you now see before you could even be begun by residents of Youlgreave and others.
They are honoured that Ypres Cathedral chose to accept their work.

## The Sculpture

The design for the sculpture draws on a number of elements.

- Its theme is the link between Youlgrave and Ypres forged during WW1.
- Its foundation is 4 replica war grave headstones.
- Above the stones sit two semicircular tables embracing twin sculptures of the spire and tower of each town's principal church.
- Embracing the sculptures, four quadrants link the towers and tables.

In this form the sculpture was first erected in All Saints Youlgrave church in August 2018.
The whole assembly was transferred to St Martins Cathedral in Ieper for its inauguration there on 19th August 2018.
After some months the two halves were separated, the Youlgreave section returning to All Saints Church and the Ypres section remaining in the side chapel of St Martins.

The intention is to exchange the halves from time to time.
